# Data Center System Deployment Manual

## Introduction

This document is a guide to install, configure and run the Data Center System of the BSN Spartan Network. This local system will help users manage their data centers and manage nodes and NTT. The system only interacts with installed full nodes of Non-Cryptocurrency Public Chains on Spartan Network, and never connects to any external third-party systems.

    ```sql
    show tables;
    ```

## 2. Download and Configuration

### 2.1 Downloading the Package

Download the package of the [Data Center Management System](https://github.com/BSN-Spartan/Data-Center-System/releases/tag/v1.1.1). In the same link, you can also download the source code and compile it by yourself.

### 2.2 Downloading Configuration Files

Download the configuration files, including [application.yml](https://github.com/BSN-Spartan/Data-Center-System/blob/main/src/main/resources/application.yml), [application-prod.yml](https://github.com/BSN-Spartan/Data-Center-System/blob/main/src/main/resources/application-prod.yml) and [logback-spring.xml](https://github.com/BSN-Spartan/Data-Center-System/blob/main/src/main/resources/logback-spring.xml).

### 2.3 Configuration

#### 2.3.1 Editing `application.yml`

- Configure the email

  ```yml
  spring:
    mail:
    # The server address for the email, for exampleï¼šsmtp.gmail.com, smtp.office365.com
      host: smtp.office365.com
    # The server port
      port: 587
    # The sender address of the email
      username: spartan_example@hotmail.com
    # App password gained after enabling the two-step verification 
      password: App_password
  ```



- Change the default login account information

  If the database has never been initialized with any account before, the service will be initialized with this information when started:

  ```yml
  system:
    adminName: admin
    adminEmail: spartan_example@hotmail.com
    defaultPassword: password
  ```

- Configure Kong gateway

  Configure the username and password of Kong gateway

  ```yml
  kongGateWayConfig:
    # Username configured in the operations and maintenance system
    username: username
    # Password configured in the operations and maintenance system
    password: password
    # User access key URL
    userAccessKeyUrl: /gateway/api/v0/accessKey/save
    # User default request configuration
    userDefaultReqConfig: /gateway/api/v0/accessKey/defaultConfig
  ```

#### 2.3.2 Editing `application-prod.yml`

- Configure the data source

  ```yml
  server:
    # Specify the port that runs the Data Center System
    port: 8085
  mysql:
    # Specify the IP address, port number and the name of your database
    write_url: jdbc:mysql://database-IP:port/db_name?useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=utf-8&zeroDateTimeBehavior=convertToNull&serverTimezone=UTC&allowMultiQueries=true&useSSL=false
    # Enter the login name of the database
    write_username: db_username
    # Enter the password
    write_password: db_password
    # Specify the IP address, port number and the name of your database
    read_url: jdbc:mysql://database-IP:port/db_name?useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=utf-8&zeroDateTimeBehavior=convertToNull&serverTimezone=UTC&allowMultiQueries=true&useSSL=false
    # Enter the login name of the database
    read_username: db_username
    # Enter the password
    read_password: db_password
  ```
  Example:

  ![](https://github.com/BSN-Spartan/Data-Center-System/blob/main/images/7.%20appprod.jpg?raw=true)

- Configure the node information

  ```yml
   chain:
    # Default Node's JSON-RPC interface of Spartan-I Chain
    nodeRpcAddress: "http://node-IP:node-rpc-port"
    # Default Chain's network ID, do not change this configuration
    chainId: 9090
    # Query the transaction pool's waiting time: millisecond, recommended 1.5 seconds
    txPoolSleep: 1500
    # Change the path of the Keystore file to a designated directory
    walletFilePath: "your-directory/wallet"
    # This number is recommended to be set as the latest block height of the Default Chain before the Data Center System started. The system can then parse events from all blocks after this block height. For example: blockHeight: 270441
    # Get the block height method: https://spartanone.bsn.foundation
    blockHeight: block_height
  ```
  Example:

  ![](https://github.com/BSN-Spartan/Data-Center-System/blob/main/images/8.%20prod2.jpg?raw=true)

- Configure the email sender name (system name)

  ```yml
  # Send email sender name (system name), indicates the name of the sender who sends the email address.
  sys-name: BSN-Spartan
  captchaTimeOut: 5
  ```



## 3. Starting the Service

### 3.1 Starting by Package

Make sure Java 1.8 or later version has been installed in your system.
```
java -version
```

![](https://github.com/BSN-Spartan/Data-Center-System/blob/main/images/5.jpg?raw=true)

Put `Data-Center-System-1.1.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`, `application.yml`,  `application-prod.yml` and `logback-spring.xml` files into the same directory and run the command below:

```yml
java -jar Data-Center-System-1.1.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.config.location=./application.yml --spring.config.location=./application-prod.yml --logging.config=./logback-spring.xml - LANG=zh_CN.UTF-8
```
Result:
![](https://github.com/BSN-Spartan/Data-Center-System/blob/main/images/9.rundatacenter.jpg?raw=true)

After starting up the Data Center System, you may find the "the basic information of data center is not configured" error message in the process. You need to configure the information after logging into the system.

You can also execute in background by `nohup`command:

```yml
nohup java -jar Data-Center-System-1.1.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.config.location=./application.yml --spring.config.location=./application-prod.yml --logging.config=./logback-spring.xml - LANG=zh_CN.UTF-8 > output.log 2>&1 &
```

### 3.2 Starting by Docker

The container is `/bsn/spartan-dc` and the service working directory can be configured by the Data Center Operator:

```yml
version: "3"
services:
  spartan-dc:
    image: oracle-jdk11
    container_name: spartan-dc
    working_dir: /bsn/spartan-dc
    restart: always
    #privileged: true
    ports:
      - "8085:8085"
    volumes:
      - ./Data-Center-System-1.1.1-SNAPSHOT.jar:/bsn/spartan-dc/Data-Center-System-1.1.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
      - ./conf:/bsn/spartan-dc/conf
      - ./logs/:/bsn/spartan-dc/logs
      - ./wallet:/bsn/spartan-dc/src/main/resources/wallet
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime
      #- /root/skywalking-agent/:/bsn/spartan-dc/skywalking-agent
    environment:
      # Specify the time zone
      - TZ=Asia/Shanghai
    entrypoint: java -jar Data-Center-System-1.1.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.config.location=./conf/application.yml --spring.config.location=./conf/application-prod.yml --logging.config=./conf/logback-spring.xml - LANG=zh_CN.UTF-8
```
## 4. Data Center Registration

After successfully starting the service, the Data Center Operator can access to the system from `http://server_IP:server_port`.
>The server_port is refering to the port in application_prod.yml

![](https://github.com/BSN-Spartan/Data-Center-System/blob/main/images/10.DChome.jpg?raw=true)

Before using the System, the Data Center Operator should go to the [Spartan Official Website](http://spartan.bsn.foundation/) to register a new data center.

Please refer to the [BSN Spartan Network User Manual](http://spartan.bsn.foundation/static/quick-start/2gettingStarted/2-1-4.html) for detailed instructions.


## 5. Data Center Gateway Deployment
After deploying and running the Data Center Management System, Data Center Operators can deploy Kong Gateway service to manage end-user's netowrk access. Click to see more information of [Data Center Gateway Deployment](https://github.com/BSN-Spartan/Data-Center-Gateway).

## 6. Data Center Portal Deployment
Data Center Service Providers can build portals to serve their end-users. Here is a template of the deployment of [BSN Spartan Network Data Center Portal](https://github.com/BSN-Spartan/Data-Center-Portal).


## 7. Data Center Management System Upgrade

If you have already installed the Data Center Management System with the previous version, you can upgrade it to the latest one.

Please find the upgrade instructions in [tags](https://github.com/BSN-Spartan/Data-Center-System/tags) that matches the version of your Data Center Management System.
